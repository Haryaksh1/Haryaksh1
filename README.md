<!---- 👋 Hi there! I'm Haryaksh Bhardwaj

- 👀 I'm fascinated by the intersection of mathematics and machine learning, exploring how computational approaches can solve complex problems across domains. My work spans from cross-lingual embeddings to AI-driven healthcare solutions.

- 🚀 I’m currently diving deep into Natural Language Processing, with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Explainable AI (XAI).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving LLMs, hallucination analysis, and retrieval-based architectures for more reliable and interpretable AI.
